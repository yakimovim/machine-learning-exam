# Prediction of the manner of an exercise

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.

Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification and with various types of errors. The dataset contains data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell.

The description of the dataset can be found here:

Our goal is to construct prediction function, which will take data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell and provide information if the person performs the exercise correctly or which type of error she has.

The project contains the following files:

* `analysis.R` - Intermediate R-script file with some auxiliary calculations
* `report.Rmd` - R Markdown file with description of analysis and results.
* `report.html` - HTML-file generated from `report.Rmd`.
